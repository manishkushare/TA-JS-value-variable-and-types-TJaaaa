ðŸŽ– Write a program to calculate the total price of your phone purchase. With these conditions
 * [ ] You will keep purchasing phones (hint: loop!) until you run out of bank balance.
 * [ ] You'll also buy accessories for each phone as long as your purchase amount is below your spending threshold.
 * [ ] After you've calculated your purchase amount, add in the tax, then print out the calculated purchase amount, properly formatted like ($334.76).
 * [ ] Finally, check the amount against your bank account balance to see if you can afford it or not.
